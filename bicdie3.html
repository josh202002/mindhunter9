            <h3>EVIL FOLLOWS LAZINESS</h3>
            <p class="para">We always consider old people as a burden. When no one looks after them, Old Age Home becomes a shelter for them. In a small old age home, a new worker came as a caretaker. These people require an all-time assistance, but this caretaker didn’t care at all. Due to his laziness, a poor old lady was died because he didn’t deliver the medicine on time. But sometimes “laziness” can really kill you. The caretaker’s body was found on a wheel chair in a burnt condition.</p>

             <p class="findings3">Several findings were found on the body and the investigation officers are still confused about the language scripts. They were sure about something was hidden in those scripts.</p>
