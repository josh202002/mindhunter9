            <h3>THE UNBEARABLE JEALOUSY</h3>
            <p class="para">Two childhood best friends, Jerry and Saira who shared each and everything with each other. Their bond was precious. They together joined a company. Jerry was liked more by the people at the company and he reached at a higher post than Saira. Seeing this all, the X-Factor Jealousy hit Saira very hard and she gave Jerry, a paralyzing drug, which left Jerry paralyzed forever. But in life, you get what you give. Saira was found dead in paralytic condition near the company where she worked.</p>
