                “Queen Mary’s Hospital”, a well-known renowned hospital. Some people just make a vow to destroy other people life, for their own needs. In this hospital, an attendant was there who was serving his duty with sincerity in day time, but at night, some bad stuff was going on, by him. He was illegally selling Morphine to young students and adults. People were getting addicted to this. He was playing with people’s life, to fulfill his own desires. But Karma follows you. Some days later, on a Sunday night, the attendant was found dead, with a morphine bottle in his hand.</p>
